<h3>Dont mind the creativity I am learning <HTML></HTML></h3>
<p>
I am a recent 
    graduate from the Swedish Institute. I have an associate degree in Health Science 
    and am achieving a certificate in web development. My goal is to learn computer 
    coding to build websites and software. Recently I took up a digital marketing 
    course at The Knowledge House where I learned HTML, CSS and branding. 
    I scored an internship at the BXL incubators working as a digital marketer 
    for the Womenâ€™s Business Center. During my internship I scored a full-time 
    position with F2M Fire and Drafting Designs as a layout tech.
